# Game Maker Studio 2 Action RPG Demo
 
A basic top down 2.5d RPG demo to teach me the basics of game design.

Built in Game Maker Language which is very similar to Python in its general functioning.

Key components are:

* Character Movement
* Various player states - walking, idle, running, rolling, carrying, throwing
* Fighting, taking and dealing damage including 3 weapons, sword, bomb and bow and arrow.
* Enemy AI with various states
* NPC characters with various states
* Semi-complex diaglogue trees with good/evil moral compass based on dialogue
* Sprite and level design
* A miniture quest

Some the code was heavily inspired by Shaun Spaulding's excellent Action RPG Tutorial on Youtube found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upoXH9hAKUg&list=PLPRT_JORnIuosvhfax2TQTEmN7OYTcSvK)
